# Ball Tracking in Quadrants

This project uses computer vision techniques to track the movement of colored balls across various quadrants in a video. The program identifies the entry and exit events of each ball within the defined quadrants and logs these events with timestamps.

## Overview

The video provided (`AI Assignment video.mp4`) contains four quadrants marked with red tape and labeled with numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The task is to detect balls of different colors (green, yellow, white, and orange) and record the time when they enter or exit any quadrant.

## Features

- Detects and tracks balls of specific colors (green, yellow, white/gray, and orange).
- Records the entry and exit events of each ball within the quadrants.
- Outputs the processed video with visual overlays indicating the detected balls and events.
- Generates a text file (`events.txt`) with the recorded events.

## Processed Video

The resultant video, `output.mp4`, shows the ball tracking and event detection in action. The video highlights the detected balls with their respective colors and labels the quadrants. It also annotates the entry and exit events with timestamps.
